<h3>Our Approach / Purpose of App</h3>
<br>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>
The approach we took for our app is a Single Page Application. Our SPA has MVC file structure with full CRUD for our contacts schema. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>The purpose of our app is to allow users to store important networking information. This information includes first and last names, phone numbers, addresses and social links. It's a great way for the user to keep up with their friends, family and colleagues.
</p>
<br>
<p>
At this point in our app, we're able to render our login inputs, add new contacts, read contacts and edit contacts. Although we can render our login inputs, we've yet to figure out how to get our front and back end to talk to eachother for login authentication. 
</p>
<br>
<br>



<h3>Unsolved Problems / Notes For Self</h3>
<br>
<h4>Unsolved Problems</h4>
<li>Login authentication-being able to render only our login inputs before displaying other components.</li>
<li>Modal-attempted to create a modal but ran into issues when incorporating Bootstrap.</li>
<br>
<h4>Notes To Self
<ul>
<li>Needs a signup/login page with an encrypted password and authorization flow</li>
<li>Add modal to display all contact information instead of rendering the information all at once onto the page</li>
</ul>
